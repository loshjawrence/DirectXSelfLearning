## The so-called 'Getting Started'
* In the Visual Studio 2017 section it mentions the check boxes to click when you go to add-remove programs->visual studio 2017-> modify. however you also need to click the install button that shows up when you try to make a new project for the 'universal' stuff. This will allow you to make a directx project from the new project menu.
